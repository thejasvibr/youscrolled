### You Scrolled App

We scroll *a LOT* nowadays. Your fingers do a lot of travelling, and yes, it's hard work. 
**You scrolled** helps you  quantify the distance your poor fingers travel. Move your finger
on the screen and watch as the distance it's travelled is shown on the screen. Thanks to NMR for the idea!

The app was made possible by the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) framework! 

#### Installation
* Go to the ```bin/``` folder and download the .apk file using your Android phone 
* You will need to enable installation from unknown sources. Check [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#unknown-sources) 
* If the instructions in the link above don't seem to match with what's on your phone, [Google]() up the instructions for your particular model.

Let me know how you liked the app. Ping me by email (thejasvib@gmail.com), Twitter (@BeleyurThejasvi) or yell out your feelings from a safe distance.
